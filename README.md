## Description

This mod was made specifically for the (not yet released) modpack **Dear ImGreg** to open up GT6 to new players
that are not familiar with its mechanics.

Currently it does nothing more than adding two items to the game:

* Mining Hammer
* Excavator

Both have the feature of a 3x3 AOE mining. Secondly the mod updates the internal stats of tools and adds more
recipes that can be easily obtained by starting players.
